## How Tailwind CSS Work:
- Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides pre-built utility classes instead of predefined components. It allows you to style elements directly in your HTML using small, reusable classes.
- It processes CSS dynamically using JavaScript and generates only the necessary styles at build time.
- Tailwind doesnâ€™t work like vanilla CSS; it generates CSS dynamically.

## @tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities; what is this?
- These three lines are Tailwind CSS directives that tell Tailwind how to process styles when building your CSS. Hereâ€™s what each one does:

## How Tailwind Generates CSS
- When you add utility classes in your HTML, Tailwind processes and compiles them into a final CSS file using its CLI.

## Advanced Features
- Tailwindâ€™s Responsive Design
- Dark Mode Support (ðŸ’¡ Use dark: for dark mode styling.)
  
## Note:
Whenever we changing anything in index.html or input.css file the we have to rerun this script(thing added 3 line in input.css file) again and again. for that what we can do it, we can instead add a watch flag.
